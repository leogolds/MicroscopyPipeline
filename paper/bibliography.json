Segmenting a nucleus is an important part of diagnosing, staging, and grading cancer, but overlapping regions make it hard to separate and tell apart independent nuclei.

This paper presents a systematic survey on nucleus segmentation using deep learning in the last five years (2017–2021), highlighting various segmentation models (U-Net, SCPP-Net, Sharp U-Net, and LiverNet) and exploring their similarities, strengths, datasets utilized, and unfolding research areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Basu","given":"Anusua"},{"family":"Senapati","given":"Pradip"},{"family":"Deb","given":"Mainak"},{"family":"Rai","given":"Rebika"},{"family":"Dhal","given":"Krishna Gopal"}],"citation-key":"basuSurveyRecentTrends2023","container-title":"Evolving Systems","container-title-short":"Evolving Systems","DOI":"10.1007/s12530-023-09491-3","ISSN":"1868-6486","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,6]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"A survey on recent trends in deep learning for nucleus segmentation from histopathology images","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12530-023-09491-3"},

Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by interactively providing sparse training annotations for a nonlinear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five dimensions (3D, time and number of channels). Its computational back end runs operations on-demand wherever possible, allowing for interactive prediction on data larger than RAM. Once the classifiers are trained, ilastik workflows can be applied to new data from the command line without further user interaction.

  {"id":"bockGeneralizedVoronoiTessellation2010","abstract":"Voronoi tessellations have been used to model the geometric arrangement of cells in morphogenetic or cancerous tissues, however, so far only with flat hyper-surfaces as cell-cell contact borders. In order to reproduce the experimentally observed piecewise spherical boundary shapes, we develop a consistent theoretical framework of multiplicatively weighted distance functions, defining generalized finite Voronoi neighborhoods around cell bodies of varying radius, which serve as heterogeneous generators of the resulting model tissue. The interactions between cells are represented by adhesive and repelling force densities on the cell contact borders. In addition, protrusive locomotion forces are implemented along the cell boundaries at the tissue margin, and stochastic perturbations allow for non-deterministic motility effects. Simulations of the emerging system of stochastic differential equations for position and velocity of cell centers show the feasibility of this Voronoi method generating realistic cell shapes. In the limiting case of a single cell pair in brief contact, the dynamical nonlinear Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is analytically investigated. In general, topologically distinct tissue conformations are observed, exhibiting stability on different time scales, and tissue coherence is quantified by suitable characteristics. Finally, an argument is derived pointing to a tradeoff in natural tissues between cell size heterogeneity and the extension of cellular lamellae.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bock","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Tyagi","given":"Amit Kumar"},{"family":"Kreft","given":"Jan-Ulrich"},{"family":"Alt","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"bockGeneralizedVoronoiTessellation2010","container-title":"Bulletin of Mathematical Biology","container-title-short":"Bull.

By including such dynamic features, the method can identify dividing cells in time series with 30 min frame intervals, and handle large cell displacements between frames.

This knowledge is a decisive factor in biological research and also in all drug development steps, medicinal or preventive therapies. Experimental cell analysis is hard, expensive, and time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, in recent years, several computational object tracking methods, software system and packages have been developed in cell sciences that bring together different disciplines and branches of technologies. Object tracking is the process of locating and monitoring specific object and its behavior in sequential images. In this paper, a comprehensive review on object tracking stages and computational methods that are utilized in terms of cell tracking has been organized. Besides, the available software packages and toolkits, challenges, and their solution in time lapse microscopy images in this scope were reviewed.

Advances in imaging techniques have paved the way to monitor cell motility. An ever-growing collection of computational tools to track cells has improved our ability to analyze moving cells. One renowned goal in the field is to provide tools that track cell movement as comprehensively and automatically as possible. However, fully automated tracking over long intervals of time is challenged by dividing cells, thus calling for a combination of automated and supervised tracking. Furthermore, after the emergence of various experimental tools to monitor cell-cycle phases, it is of relevance to integrate the monitoring of cell-cycle phases and motility. We developed CellMAPtracer, a multiplatform tracking system that achieves that goal. It can be operated as a conventional, automated tracking tool of single cells in numerous imaging applications. However, CellMAPtracer also allows adjusting tracked cells in a semiautomated supervised fashion, thereby improving the accuracy and facilitating the long-term tracking of migratory and dividing cells. CellMAPtracer is available with a user-friendly graphical interface and does not require any coding or programming skills. CellMAPtracer is compatible with two- and three-color fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI) systems and allows the user to accurately monitor various migration parameters throughout the cell cycle, thus having great potential to facilitate new discoveries in cell biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghannoum","given":"Salim"},{"family":"Antos","given":"Kamil"},{"family":"Leoncio Netto","given":"Waldir"},{"family":"Gomes","given":"Cecil"},{"family":"Köhn-Luque","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Farhan","given":"Hesso"}],"citation-key":"ghannoumCellMAPtracerUserFriendlyTracking2021","container-title":"Cells","DOI":"10.3390/cells10020469","ISSN":"2073-4409","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"469","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"CellMAPtracer: A User-Friendly Tracking Tool for Long-Term Migratory and Proliferating Cells Associated with FUCCI Systems","title-short":"CellMAPtracer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/2/469","volume":"10"},

We have done comparative analysis for four edge detectors that use different methods for detecting edges and have tested their results under a variety of situations to determine which detector was preferable under different circumstances. For practical analysis it was used to detect the edges and results have been compared with the gradient based methods of edge detection like Sobel, Prewitt, Robert these are first order derivative methods. Testing and analysis on different satellite images by Laplacian and gradient based method have done by using the ideal thresholding parameter for good true edges.To evaluate the performance of Laplacian based algorithms and gradient based algorithms. There is a need of calculating the some parameter for calculating the image quality. These parameters are able to identify which algorithm is best suited in detecting edges for satellite images.","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Sunil"},{"family":"Upadhyay","given":"Amit Kumar"},{"family":"Dubey","given":"Preeti"},{"family":"Varshney","given":"Sudeep"}],"citation-key":"kumarComparativeAnalysisEdge2021a","container-title":"2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICCCIS51004.2021.9397225","event-title":"2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"page":"675-681","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Comparative analysis for Edge Detection Techniques","type":"paper-conference"},

A common source of segmentation error is tight clustering of nuclei. There is a compelling need to minimize these errors for constructing highly automated scoring systems.\nMETHODS: A combination of two approaches is presented. First, an improved distance transform combining intensity gradients and geometric distance is used for the watershed step. Second, an explicit mathematical model for the anatomic characteristics of cell nuclei such as size and shape measures is incorporated. This model is constructed automatically from the data. Deliberate initial over-segmentation of the image data is performed, followed by statistical model-based merging. A confidence score is computed for each detected nucleus, measuring how well the nucleus fits the model. This is used in combination with the intensity gradient to control the merge decisions.\nRESULTS: Experimental validation on a set of rodent brain cell images showed 97% concordance with the human observer and significant improvement over prior methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combining a gradient-weighted distance transform with a richer morphometric model significantly improves the accuracy of automated segmentation and FISH analysis.","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Adiga","given":"Umesh"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Guzowski","given":"John F."},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Carol A."},{"family":"Roysam","given":"Badrinath"}],"citation-key":"linHybrid3DWatershed2003","container-title":"Cytometry.

The watershed algorithm is usually used to segment cells in the image. However, it is difficult to segment touched cells. Traditional watershed algorithms, based either on a distance map or on a gradient map, easily result in over-segmentation because they only consider location information or edge information of a pixel in an image. In this paper a top/bottom transformation is used to enhance an image, a combined transformation on multi-scale gradient and distance is proposed, and then the watershed algorithm is used to segment cell images. The improved algorithm can reduce the influence of noise, and give good results when segmenting cells in series and interlink because it includes both location and edge information.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Yinghong"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingjie"}],"citation-key":"liuImprovedWatershedAlgorithm2010","container-title":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","DOI":"10.1109/CISP.2010.5646802","event-title":"2010 3rd International Congress on Image and Signal Processing","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"page":"3750-3754","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"An improved watershed algorithm based on multi-scale gradient and distance transformation","type":"paper-conference","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"malpicaApplyingWatershedAlgorithms1997","abstract":"Cluster division is a critical issue in fluorescence microscopy-based analytical cytology when preparation protocols do not provide appropriate separation of objects. Overlooking clustered nuclei and analyzing only isolated nuclei may dramatically increase analysis time or affect the statistical validation of the results. Automatic segmentation of clustered nuclei requires the implementation of specific image segmentation tools. Most algorithms are inspired by one of the two following strategies: 1) cluster division by the detection of internuclei gradients; or 2) division by definition of domains of influence (geometrical approach). Both strategies lead to completely different implementations, and usually algorithms based on a single view strategy fail to correctly segment most clustered nuclei, or perform well just for a specific type of sample. An algorithm based on morphological watersheds has been implemented and tested on the segmentation of microscopic nuclei clusters. This algorithm provides a tool that can be used for the implementation of both gradient- and domain-based algorithms, and, more importantly, for the implementation of mixed (gradient- and shape-based) algorithms. Using this algorithm, almost 90% of the test clusters were correctly segmented in peripheral blood and bone marrow preparations. The algorithm was valid for both types of samples, using the appropriate markers and transformations.","author":[{"family":"Malpica","given":"N."},{"family":"Solórzano","given":"C.

  {"id":"meijeringCellSegmentation502012","abstract":"Ever since the establishment of cell theory in the early 19th century, which recognized the cell as the fundamental building unit of life, biologists have sought to explain the underlying principles. Momentous discoveries were made over the course of many decades of research [1], but the quest to attain full understanding of cellular mechanisms and how to manipulate them to improve health continues to the present day, with bigger budgets, more minds, and more sophisticated tools than ever before. One of the tools to which a great deal of the progress in cell biology can be attributed is light microscopy [2]. The field has come a long way since Antoni van Leeuwenhoeks first steps in the 1670s toward improving and exploiting microscopic imaging for studying life at the cellular level. Not only do biologists today have a plethora of different, complementary microscopic imaging techniques at their disposal that enable them to visualize phenomena even way below the classical diffraction limit of light, advanced microscope systems also allow them to easily acquire very large numbers of images within just a matter of hours. The abundance, heterogeneity, dimensionality, and complexity of the data generated in modern imaging experiments rule out manual image management, processing, and analysis. Consequently, computerized techniques for performing these tasks have become of key importance for further progress in cell biology [3][6]. A central problem in many studies, and often regarded as the cornerstone of image analysis, is image segmentation. Specifically, since cellular morphology is an important phenotypic feature that is indicative of the physiological state of a cell, and since the cell contour is often required for subsequent analysis of intracellular processes (zooming in to nanoscale), or of cell sociology (zooming out to millimeter scale), the problem of cell segmentation has received increasing attention in past years [7]. Here we reflect on how the field has evolved over the years and how past developments can be expected to extrapolate into the future.","author":[{"family":"Meijering","given":"Erik"}],"citation-key":"meijeringCellSegmentation502012","container-title":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","DOI":"10.1109/MSP.2012.2204190","ISSN":"1558-0792","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9]]},"page":"140-145","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Cell Segmentation: 50 Years Down the Road [Life Sciences]","title-short":"Cell Segmentation","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},

While these experiments can produce rich data, the computational analysis of these datasets is challenging. Single-cell analysis requires that cells be accurately identified in each image and subsequently tracked over time. Increasingly, deep learning is being used to interpret microscopy image with single cell resolution. In this work, we apply deep learning to the problem of tracking single cells in live-cell imaging data. Using crowdsourcing and a human-in-the-loop approach to data annotation, we constructed a dataset of over 11,000 trajectories of cell nuclei that includes lineage information. Using this dataset, we successfully trained a deep learning model to perform cell tracking within a linear programming framework. Benchmarking tests demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of cell tracking with respect to multiple accuracy metrics. Further, we show that our deep learning-based method generalizes to perform cell tracking for both fluorescent and brightfield images of the cell cytoplasm, despite having never been trained on those data types. This enables analysis of live-cell imaging data collected across imaging modalities.

The past decade has seen the advent of machine learning (ML) methods to aid in this process, the overwhelming majority of which fall under supervised learning (SL) which requires vast libraries of pre-processed, human-annotated labels to train the ML algorithms. Such SL pre-processing is labor intensive, can introduce bias, varies between end-users, and has yet to be shown capable of robust models to be effectively utilized throughout the greater cell biology community. Here, to address this pre-processing problem, we offer a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach that utilizes cellular motion between consecutive images to self-train a ML classifier, enabling cell and background segmentation without the need for adjustable parameters or curated imagery. By leveraging motion, we achieve accurate segmentation that trains itself directly on end-user data, is independent of optical modality, outperforms contemporary SL methods, and does so in a completely automated fashion—thus eliminating end-user variability and bias. To the best of our knowledge, this SSL algorithm represents a first of its kind effort and has appealing features that make it an ideal segmentation tool candidate for the broader cell biology research community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Robitaille","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Byers","given":"Jeff M."},{"family":"Christodoulides","given":"Joseph A."},{"family":"Raphael","given":"Marc P."}],"citation-key":"robitailleSelfsupervisedMachineLearning2022","container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-022-04117-x","ISSN":"2399-3642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,2]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply","number":"1","page":"1-8","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Self-supervised machine learning for live cell imagery segmentation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04117-x","volume":"5"},

As a result, they do not create any new contours and are very attractive for filtering tasks where the contour information has to be preserved. This paper shows that connected operators work implicitly on a structured representation of the image made of flat zones. The max-tree is proposed as a suitable and efficient structure to deal with the processing steps involved in antiextensive connected operators. A formal definition of the various processing steps involved in the operator is proposed and, as a result, several lines of generalization are developed. First, the notion of connectivity and its definition are analyzed. Several modifications of the traditional approach are presented. They lead to connected operators that are able to deal with texture. They also allow the definition of connected operators with less leakage than the classical ones. Second, a set of simplification criteria are proposed and discussed. They lead to simplicity-, entropy-, and motion-oriented operators. The problem of using a nonincreasing criterion is analyzed. Its solution is formulated as an optimization problem that can be very efficiently solved by a Viterbi (1979) algorithm.

We use Voronoi tessellations as a mathematical framework that predicts this diversity. We demonstrate that Voronoi tessellations and the very different tissues analysed share an overriding restriction: the frequency of polygon types correlates with the distribution of cell areas. By altering the balance of tensions and pressures within the packed tissues using disease, genetic or computer model perturbations, we show that as long as packed cells present a balance of forces within tissue, they will be under a physical constraint that limits its organization.

  {"id":"soilleDeterminingWatershedsDigital1990","abstract":"The watershed transformation is a very powerful image analysis tool provided by mathematical morphology. However, most existing watershed algorithms are either too time consuming or insufficiently accurate. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new and flexible implementation of this transformation. It is based on a progressive flooding of the picture and it works for n-dimensional images. Pixels are first sorted in the increasing order of their gray values. Then, the successive gray levels are processed in order to simulate the flooding propagation. A distributive sorting technique combined with breadth-first scannings of each gray level allow an extremely fast computation. Furthermore, the present algorithm is very general since it deals with any kind of digital grid and its extension to general graphs is straightforward. Its interest with respect to image segmentation is illustrated by the extraction of geometrical shapes from a noisy image, the separation of 3-dimensional overlapping particles and by the segmentation of a digital elevation model using watersheds on images and graphs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Soille","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Vincent","given":"Luc M."}],"citation-key":"soilleDeterminingWatershedsDigital1990","container-title":"Visual Communications and Image Processing '90: Fifth in a Series","DOI":"10.1117/12.24211","event-title":"Visual Communications and Image Processing '90: Fifth in a Series","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990,9,1]]},"page":"240-250","publisher":"SPIE","source":"www.spiedigitallibrary.org","title":"Determining watersheds in digital pictures via flooding simulations","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/1360/0000/Determining-watersheds-in-digital-pictures-via-flooding-simulations/10.1117/12.24211.full","volume":"1360"},
  {"id":"stimperMultidimensionalContrastLimited2019","abstract":"Contrast enhancement is an important preprocessing technique for improving the performance of downstream tasks in image processing and computer vision. Among the existing approaches based on nonlinear histogram transformations, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is a popular choice for dealing with 2D images obtained in natural and scientific settings. The recent hardware upgrade in data acquisition systems results in significant increase in data complexity, including their sizes and dimensions. Measurements of densely sampled data higher than three dimensions, usually composed of 3D data as a function of external parameters, are becoming commonplace in various applications in the natural sciences and engineering. The initial understanding of these complex multidimensional datasets often requires human intervention through visual examination, which may be hampered by the varying levels of contrast permeating through the dimensions. We show both qualitatively and quantitatively that using our multidimensional extension of CLAHE (MCLAHE) simultaneously on all dimensions of the datasets allows better visualization and discernment of multidimensional image features, as demonstrated using cases from 4D photoemission spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Our implementation of multidimensional CLAHE in Tensorflow is publicly accessible and supports parallelization with multiple CPUs and various other hardware accelerators, including GPUs.","author":[{"family":"Stimper","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Ernstorfer","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Schölkopf","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Xian","given":"Rui Patrick"}],"citation-key":"stimperMultidimensionalContrastLimited2019","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2952899","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"165437-165447","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Multidimensional Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"streichanSpatialConstraintsControl2014","abstract":"Spatiotemporal coordination of cell growth underlies tissue development and disease. Mechanical feedback between cells has been proposed as a regulatory mechanism for growth control both in vivo and in cultured cells undergoing contact inhibition of proliferation. Evidence beyond theoretical and correlative observations falls short. In this study, we probe the impact of mechanical tissue perturbations on cell cycle progression by monitoring cell cycle dynamics of cells in tissues subject to acute changes in boundary conditions, as well as tissue stretching and compression. Taken together, we conclude that the ability of tissues to support cell cycle progression adapts to the available space through a memory-free control mechanism, which may coordinate proliferation patterns to maintain tissue homeostasis., Control of cell proliferation is a fundamental aspect of tissue formation in development and regeneration. Cells experience various spatial and mechanical constraints depending on their environmental context in the body, but we do not fully understand if and how such constraints influence cell cycle progression and thereby proliferation patterns in tissues. Here, we study the impact of mechanical manipulations on the cell cycle of individual cells within a mammalian model epithelium. By monitoring the response to experimentally applied forces, we find a checkpoint at the G1–S boundary that, in response to spatial constraints, controls cell cycle progression. This checkpoint prevents cells from entering S phase if the available space remains below a characteristic threshold because of crowding. Stretching the tissue results in fast cell cycle reactivation, whereas compression rapidly leads to cell cycle arrest. Our kinetic analysis of this response shows that cells have no memory of past constraints and allows us to formulate a biophysical model that predicts tissue growth in response to changes in spatial constraints in the environment. This characteristic biomechanical cell cycle response likely serves as a fundamental control mechanism to maintain tissue integrity and to ensure control of tissue growth during development and regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Streichan","given":"Sebastian J."},{"family":"Hoerner","given":"Christian R."},{"family":"Schneidt","given":"Tatjana"},{"family":"Holzer","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Hufnagel","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"streichanSpatialConstraintsControl2014","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1323016111","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,15]]},"page":"5586-5591","PMCID":"PMC3992650","PMID":"24706777","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Spatial constraints control cell proliferation in tissues","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3992650/","volume":"111"},

In tissues, osmotic regulation takes place through blood and lymphatic capillaries and, at a single cell level, water and osmoregulation play a critical role. However, the effect of osmotic pressure on single cell cycle dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of osmotic pressure on single cell cycle dynamics, nuclear growth, proliferation, migration and protein expression, by quantitative time-lapse imaging of single cells genetically modified with fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator 2 (FUCCI2). Single cell data reveals that under hyperosmotic stress, distinct cell subpopulations emerge with impaired nuclear growth, delayed or growth arrested cell cycle and reduced migration. This state is reversible for mild hyperosmotic stress, where cells return to regular cell cycle dynamics, proliferation and migration. Thus, osmotic pressure can modulate the reversible growth arrest and reactivation of human metastatic cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Taïeb","given":"Hubert M."},{"family":"Garske","given":"Daniela S."},{"family":"Contzen","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Gossen","given":"Manfred"},{"family":"Bertinetti","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Cipitria","given":"Amaia"}],"citation-key":"taiebOsmoticPressureModulates2021","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-92054-w","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"13455","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Osmotic pressure modulates single cell cycle dynamics inducing reversible growth arrest and reactivation of human metastatic cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92054-w","volume":"11"},

It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis.

Time-lapse microscopy imaging serves as an important method to measure the cycle progression of individual cells in a large population. Since manual analysis is unreasonably time consuming for the large volumes of time-lapse image data, automated image analysis is proposed. Existing approaches dealing with time-lapse image data are rather limited and often give inaccurate analysis results, especially in segmenting and tracking individual cells in a cell population. In this paper, we present a new approach to segment and track cell nuclei in time-lapse fluorescence image sequence. First, we propose a novel marker-controlled watershed based on mathematical morphology, which can effectively segment clustered cells with less oversegmentation. To further segment undersegmented cells or to merge oversegmented cells, context information among neighboring frames is employed, which is proved to be an effective strategy. Then, we design a tracking method based on modified mean shift algorithm, in which several kernels with adaptive scale, shape, and direction are designed. Finally, we combine mean-shift and Kalman filter to achieve a more robust cell nuclei tracking method than existing ones. Experimental results show that our method can obtain 98.8% segmentation accuracy, 97.4% cell division tracking accuracy, and 97.6% cell tracking accuracy.","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaodong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Houqiang"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaobo"}],"citation-key":"yangNucleiSegmentationUsing2006","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","DOI":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.884469","ISSN":"1558-0806","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,11]]},"page":"2405-2414","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Nuclei Segmentation Using Marker-Controlled Watershed, Tracking Using Mean-Shift, and Kalman Filter in Time-Lapse Microscopy","type":"article-journal","volume":"53"},
